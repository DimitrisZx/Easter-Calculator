# Easter-Calculator

This is a Calculator that calculates the dates for the Orthodox and the Catholic Easter for the year the user has input and it was created for a school assignment. Most of the formulas are taken from the lesson's notes and the rest was coded by me. There was a little problem in calculating the Gregorian Epact for the Catholic Easter, due to the modulo bug in JavaScript, which I solved by providing an extra function from Stack Overflow.

I've had some issues passing the values correctly in the HTML form from the JS functions, but the friendly people over at Stack Overflow again were really helpful with fixing my problem. Try it for yourselves and notify me of any bugs!
